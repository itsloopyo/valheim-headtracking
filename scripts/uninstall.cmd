:: Under `cmd /V:ON`, or with DelayedExpansion=1 in
:: HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor, cmd.exe eats a `!` out of the
:: expanded line, and a real game path like C:\Games\Oh! My Game reaches the
:: body already mangled. The body pins expansion off at its own outer scope
:: too, but that is one `call` too late to save the argument it was handed.
